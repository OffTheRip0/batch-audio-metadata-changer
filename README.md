# batch-audio-metadata-changer
A simple python script I made to fix a problem I had with having too many unreleased Juice WRLD songs saved locally but with weird file names and no metadata for artist and song name

**Usage-**

Please change the file path to your desired path with all your audio files saved then run the script

Also make sure to install sounddevice and pydub, you can use the command below.

    pip install sounddevice pydub
